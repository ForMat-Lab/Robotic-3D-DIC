    "# Summary of the Code for generating Strain images\n",
    "\n",
    "This script simulates the stretching and recovery of an image by generating a sequence of images that illustrate both expansion (stretching) and contraction (shrinking) along the horizontal (`x`) and vertical (`y`) axes. The image is padded with a white frame to prevent clipping during transformations. The sequence of images is saved in a specified output directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### `add_white_frame(image, max_strain)`\n",
    "Adds a white frame around the image to accommodate maximum strain in both width and height. This ensures that the image can expand without any clipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `image`: Original image (PIL.Image object).\n",
    "- `max_strain`: Maximum strain (float).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- PIL.Image object with a white frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `stretch_image(image, strain, step, total_steps, axis, shrink=False)`\n",
    "Stretches or shrinks the image based on the current step and the specified strain value. The transformation occurs along the given axis (`x` or `y`), and the image is resized accordingly. A white background is added to ensure the transformed image fits within the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `image`: Original image (PIL.Image object).\n",
    "- `strain`: Maximum strain (float).\n",
    "- `step`: Current step (int).\n",
    "- `total_steps`: Total number of steps (int).\n",
    "- `axis`: Axis of strain ('x' for width, 'y' for height).\n",
    "- `shrink`: Whether to shrink the image (if `True`, it shrinks instead of stretching).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- Stretched or shrunk PIL.Image object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `simulate_image_stretching(image_path, base_output_dir, max_strain, desired_images)`\n",
    "The main function that performs the image stretching and recovery simulation. It creates a series of images with the following steps:\n",
    "- Add a consistent white frame to the original image.\n",
    "- Stretch the image along the `x` axis (expansion), then recover it back to the original size.\n",
    "- Stretch and recover the image along the `y` axis.\n",
    "- Generate 3 identical copies of the final image.\n",
    "- Save all the images in a directory named with the current date and the desired number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `image_path`: Path to the input image (str).\n",
    "- `base_output_dir`: Base directory to save the output images (str).\n",
    "- `max_strain`: Maximum strain (float).\n",
    "- `desired_images`: Desired total number of images to be generated (int).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Image**: The script starts by loading the input image and calculating the number of steps required for each phase of stretching and recovery.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Image Transformation**: The image undergoes stretching and shrinking both horizontally (x-axis) and vertically (y-axis), with each step creating a new image.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **White Frame**: To avoid clipping, a white frame is added around the image during all transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**: A unique output folder is created using the current date, and the images are saved sequentially in that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Images**: After all transformations, the last image is duplicated three times and saved to the output directory."
